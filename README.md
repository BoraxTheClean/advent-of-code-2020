# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020). This repository represents wonderful, joyful memories of solving these problems.

These solutions are not meant to be particularly readable, optimized, or educational. I write these solutions until I solve the problem. I rarely go back and refine each solution.

Instead these solutions represent the raw thoughts and code that I had when solving these problems. Not all code has to be pretty or refined.

There is a form of beauty in presenting this raw, messy, code that I throw together filled with joy and glee each day solving these problems.
